# Frontend for Decentralist

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case in the form of a decentralized playlist. It comes with a smart contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract. Frontend made with basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.

This is a Dapp hosted on the Rinkeby network, which lets users around the world add songs to a decentralized playlist. Upon adding, the corresponding wallet address and time of addition are displayed and the user is given a 33% chance of receiving a reward of 0.001 $ETH. A cooldown period of 2 minutes per wallet per entry has been implemented to prevent malicious attempts at arbitrage of the rewards system.

Steps to contribute to the playlist- <br />
1) Get a hot wallet and connect to the Rinkeby test network <br />
2) Use the testnet faucet available on https://mycrypto.com/ to get $ETH for gas <br />
3) Go to https://decentralist.parathaprat.repl.co <br />
4) Click on connect wallet, and connect your wallet to the dapp <br />
5) Enter desired song into the given textbox, confirm transaction and you are done! <br />
