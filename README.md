# Frontend for Decentralist

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case in the form of a decentralized playlist. It comes with a smart contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

This is a Dapp hosted on the Rinkeby network, which lets users around the world add songs to a decentralized playlist. Upon adding, the corresponding wallet address and time of addition are displayed and the user is given a 33% chance of receiving a reward of 0.001 $ETH. A cooldown period of 2 minutes per wallet per entry has been implemented to prevent malicious attempts at arbitrage of the rewards system.
